## ü§ù Contributing

This project is open to contributions and new ideas! If you‚Äôd like to help grow it:

1. **Pick one of the variations above** that hasn‚Äôt been implemented yet.
2. **Open an issue** in the format:  
   `Game variation: <name of variation>`  
   Example: `Game variation: Reverse Tic Tac Toe`
3. Once the issue is open, feel free to start working on it.
4. **Submit a pull request** with your implementation!

Opening an issue with the name of the variation helps avoid overlap and ensures each variation is only handled by one contributor at a time (two developers working on same thing is a waste of time & energy).

When implementing a new game variation, please stay consistent with the UI of the existing games.

Happy coding!
